This project is a journey for me, were i will do my uttermost to write good and maintainable code.
Evryday i will spend a minimun of one hour on the project and see what happens and what kind of application it will turn out to be.


## frontEnd

My biggest problem with code is that i think evrything feels sloppy and not sustainable.
My goal in this project is tahat i will make sure that the code feels robust and unbreakable.
